The Basics
When creating a collection in SolrCloud we can adjust the creation command. Some of the parameters are mandatory, 
some of them have defaults and can be overwritten. The two main parameters we are interested in are the number of
shards and the replication factor. The former tells Solr how to divide the collection – how many distinct pieces
(shards) our collection will be split into. For example, if we say that we want to have four shards Solr will
divide the collection into four pieces, with each piece having about 25% of the documents. The replication 
factor on the other hand dictates the number of physical copies that each shard will have. So, when replication
factor is set to 1, only leader shards will be created. If replication factor is set to 2 each leader will have
one replica, if replication factor is set to 3 each leader will have two replicas and so on.

By default, Solr will put one shard of a collection on a given node. If we want to have more shards than the number
of nodes we have in the SolrCloud cluster, we need to adjust the behavior, which we also can do by using Collections
API. Of course, Solr will try to spread the shards evenly around the cluster, but we can also adjust that behavior 
by telling Solr on which nodes shards should be created.

Let’s look at this next. For the purpose of showing you how all of this works, I’ll use Docker and Docker Compose.
I’ll launch four containers with SolrCloud and one container with ZooKeeper. I’ll use the following docker-compose.yml
file:

Start all containers by running:

$ docker-compose up
